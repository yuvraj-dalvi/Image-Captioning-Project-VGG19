1) While Running the code, you will need to use the 'captions.txt' file.
2) Upload the 'captions.txt' file from this zipped folder on to your google drive.
3) In the code mount your google drive and replace the file path of 'captions.txt' with the path of 
the 'captions.txt' you uploaded in google drive mentioned above in step 2

4) In google collab after the code of Base Directory is created, you will need to create 
a folder called "Working DIR 8k" in the base directory "Flicker8k_Dataset". 
After mounting drive and running the base directory code, right click on the "Flicker8k_Dataset" base directory and
click create folder. Name this folder "Working DIR 8k". It is required for further code.
